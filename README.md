# Top Headlines 4 Part Series

This is the completed project for my YouTube series on building an app that uses the newsapi.ort API to fetch and display news from a variety of different sources and countries.



> **Note:** The APO|I Key has been removed from this repo so if you want to run the project you will have to get your own freen API key from https://newsapi.org
